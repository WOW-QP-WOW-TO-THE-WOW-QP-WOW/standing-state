# D006 — Canonical Essay Deployment Doctrine
# Standing State Press · standingstate.com

## Purpose

Deploy canonical essays to standingstate.com without rediscovering repository
structure each time.

Core command: **Read DEPLOYMENT_DOCTRINE.md and execute.**

---

## 1. Source Before Action

Before writing any file, read the following from the current source zip:

- `pages/essays/index.js` — understand the ESSAYS array structure and insertion point
- At least one current standalone canonical essay page (not import-based) — confirm active pattern
- Any registry or metadata file involved (e.g. `data/essays/`)

Do not assume repo structure from prior chats. The source zip is the authority.

**Known failure pattern:** Prior sessions built content-module import pages
(`import { essay } from '../../../content/essays/...'`) that do not match the
corpus pattern. Always verify the active pattern from source before building.

## 2. Canonical Essay Completion Checklist

A canonical essay is not complete until ALL of the following are true:

- [ ] Standalone page exists at `pages/essays/canonical/[slug].js`
- [ ] Route resolves: `/essays/canonical/[slug]`
- [ ] Page follows current repo-native standalone pattern:
  - Full nav inline (`<nav className="nav">`)
  - Header inline (`<header className="glossHeader canonMonument">`)
  - Breadcrumb inline
  - Body inline — no content module import
  - CSS classes: `canonEssayWrap`, `canonEssayBlock`, `canonEssayLabel`,
    `canonEssayBody`, `canonEssayPara`, `canonEssayNav`, `canonNavLink`
- [ ] Essay registered in `pages/essays/index.js` ESSAYS array
- [ ] Registry/metadata updated if repo uses one (`data/essays/`)
- [ ] Read / Site / Mirror / Lineage navigation present in header
- [ ] Mirror status audited (use repo metadata URL if present; mark Pending if not; never invent a URL)
- [ ] Semantic boundaries preserved:
  - `article#canonical-essay` (or `article className="canonEssay"`)
  - `h1#essay-title` (or `h1 className="glossH1"`)
  - `section#essay-body`
- [ ] Reader markers preserved if used by repo:
  - `<span id="essay-reader-start" aria-hidden="true" />`
  - `<span id="essay-reader-end" aria-hidden="true" />`
- [ ] Lineage stated in header and nav footer
- [ ] No unrelated files changed
- [ ] Bracket balance verified: `{}` and `()` both 0 on all modified JS files
- [ ] GitHub upload zip produced

---

## 3. Failure Rule

Do not declare completion until the checklist is satisfied.

If a prior session produced a file that fails the checklist, rebuild it.
Do not patch a non-compliant file — replace it.

---

## 4. Validation Report

Every deployment must report:

- Files changed (list each)
- Page route confirmed
- Index updated (yes / no — which entries added)
- Registry updated (yes / no / not applicable)
- Mirror status (URL or Pending — source cited)
- Lineage confirmed (full chain)
- Reader markers confirmed (present / absent)
- Semantic boundaries confirmed (present / absent)
- Bracket balance (pass / fail)
- Zip filename
- Assumptions made (explicit list)

---

## 5. Packaging Convention

Zip name: `standing_state_[essay_id_or_slug]_deployment_patch.zip`

Zip must contain files at their exact repo paths, e.g.:
- `pages/essays/canonical/the-geometry-of-continuity.js`
- `pages/essays/index.js`
- `DEPLOYMENT_DOCTRINE.md`

---

## 6. Index Registration Pattern

In `pages/essays/index.js`, entries follow this shape:

```js
{
  id: 'M081',
  title: 'The Geometry of Inquiry',
  mediumUrl: '',
  axis1: 'INQUIRY-ARCH',
  axis2: 'VOL-CROSS',
  axis3: 'REG-CONST',
  flag: 'M',
  note: '...',
  mirrorUrl: '/essays/canonical/[slug]',
},
```

- `mediumUrl`: Medium URL if published there; empty string if not
- `mirrorUrl`: canonical site route
- `flag`: use `'M'` for mirrored to site
- Append new entries before the closing `]` of the ESSAYS array

---

## 7. Known Repo Facts (update when source changes)

- Framework: Next.js, Pages Router, JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- Deploy: Vercel
- Canonical essays: standalone static files, `pages/essays/canonical/[slug].js`
- Dynamic routes: plates (`pages/system/plates/[slug].js`), doctrine (`pages/system/doctrine/[slug].js`)
- Essay index: `pages/essays/index.js`, ESSAYS array
- Corpus position at last audit: M081, P034, D005
- Content module pattern (`content/essays/`) is legacy/unused — do not introduce
